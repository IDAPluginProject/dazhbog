<br />

`dazhbog` is a self-contained Lumina-compatible server that stores, retrieves, indexes, and analyzes function metadata from IDA Pro. It combines embedded deployment, context-aware version selection, binary analytics, full-text search, native metadata decoding, and a browser workbench.

It answers more than "do I have this function?" It also answers "which binary families contain it?", "which version best fits this caller?", and "what metadata does Lumina have for this symbol?"

## At a glance

| Area | What it does |
|------|------------------|
| **Lumina RPC** | Supports protocol versions `0` through `6`, including push, pull, delete, and history flows |
| **Storage** | Uses sled-backed append-only segment trees plus a persistent latest-record index |
| **Context** | Tracks binary MD5s, basenames, observations, per-version stats, overlap caches, and binary facets in `context_db` |
| **Search** | Indexes raw names, demangled names, language tags, and binary names with Tantivy |
| **Web UI** | Serves a dashboard plus APIs for function detail, binary browsing, overlap, timelines, graph views, and binary comparison |
| **Metadata** | Parses Lumina metadata natively in Rust, including types, frame data, comments, and switch/jumptable hints |
| **Recovery** | Can migrate context data, rebuild indexes, rebuild search, rebuild basenames, and run full recovery flows |
| **Upstream** | Optionally forwards cache misses to one or more upstream Lumina servers by priority |

## Why dazhbog

- **Embedded, not operationally heavy** - no external database, search service, or queueing tier required
- **More than a cache** - keeps history, context, binary observations, and per-version statistics
- **Browsable corpus** - ships with an HTTP workbench instead of leaving the data behind the Lumina protocol
- **Built for reverse-engineering workflows** - binary overlap, function history, demangling, comment/type extraction, and metadata-rich comparison are first-class features
- **Recoverable by design** - segment data, context data, and search state can be rebuilt with dedicated tooling

## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/dazhbog config.toml
```

For a development run:

```bash
cargo run -- config.toml
```

If IDA is talking to a non-TLS `dazhbog` instance:

```bash
export LUMINA_TLS=false
```

---------------

## What it does

`dazhbog` gives teams local Lumina compatibility with search, context, and visibility into the dataset.

- **A context database** in `context_db/` for binary metadata, per-key basenames, binary/version stats, overlap caches, and facet summaries
- **A search layer** in `search_index/` using Tantivy for symbols, demangled names, languages, and binary names
- **Web APIs and a browser workbench** in `src/api/http/` for function details, binary explorer views, graph exploration, overlap analysis, and compare workflows
- **Universal symbol demangling** for Itanium C++, MSVC, Rust, Swift, Go, and D
- **A native Lumina metadata parser** in `src/protocol/lumina/metadata.rs`
- **Recovery tooling** that can migrate context data, rebuild the latest index, rebuild basenames, rebuild search, and run full recovery passes
- **Binary analysis features** including family timelines, overlap percentages, related binaries, and compare buckets such as shared, left-only, right-only, metadata-rich, rare-symbol, and freshest-drift

## Features

### Core server

- **Embedded storage** - no external database required
- **Protocol support** - compatible with IDA Pro Lumina protocol versions `0-6`
- **Append-only records** - immutable history via `prev_addr` chains
- **Context-aware version selection** - chooses the best candidate using binary MD5, basename similarity, co-occurrence, stability, recency, and binary popularity
- **Optional upstream forwarding** - one or more upstream Lumina servers with priority ordering
- **TLS support** - PKCS#12 via `native-tls` or PEM via `rustls`

### Search and web workbench

- **Function search** by stored symbol, demangled symbol, or associated binary name
- **Binary search** by basename and observed metadata
- **Function detail API** at `/api/function/:key`
- **Binary detail API** at `/api/binary/:md5`
- **Binary graph API** at `/api/binary/:md5/graph`
- **Binary overlap API** at `/api/binary/:md5/overlap`
- **Binary comparison API** at `/api/binary-compare/:left/:right`
- **Prometheus metrics** at `/metrics`
- **Metrics JSON** at `/api/metrics`

The dashboard shows demangled names, parsed metadata, language badges, binary relationships, timeline views, coverage/facet summaries, and compare panels.

### Binary intelligence

- **Per-binary summaries** with observation counts, function counts, first/last seen timestamps, and host tracking
- **Binary overlap** discovery based on shared functions
- **Binary family timelines** for related samples
- **Neighborhood graphs** for exploring binary clusters
- **Comparison buckets** for shared, unique, metadata-rich, rare-symbol, and freshest-drift function sets
- **Facet summaries** showing typed/commented/switch-heavy coverage across a binary

### Metadata parsing

The Rust parser in `src/protocol/lumina/metadata.rs` can decode and expose:

- function type information
- frame descriptions and frame members
- decompiler elapsed values
- function comments and repeatable comments
- instruction comments and repeatable instruction comments
- derived switch and jumptable hints from parsed comments

The `analysis/` directory contains reverse-engineering notes and Python parsers used to validate the format against real dumped payloads.

---------------

## Architecture

`dazhbog` is built around four main on-disk stores and two serving layers.

### Request flow

```text
IDA client / browser
        |
        v
  Lumina RPC server / HTTP server
        |
        +--> latest key index ---------------> fetch current record
        |
        +--> context_db ---------------------> score versions, attach binaries, compute overlap/facets
        |
        +--> search_index -------------------> search functions and binaries
        |
        +--> segments_db --------------------> walk history, read raw records, parse metadata
        |
        +--> upstream servers (optional) ----> fill local cache on misses
```

### Storage layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `segments_db/` | Append-only sled trees named `seg.00001`, `seg.00002`, ... containing serialized records |
| `index/` | Persistent key -> latest address lookup |
| `context_db/` | Binary metadata, basename associations, version stats, overlap caches, facet caches, popularity data |
| `search_index/` | Tantivy full-text index for functions and binaries |

### Record model

The append-only segment record keeps:

- a 128-bit function key
- timestamps and popularity
- a pointer to the previous version via `prev_addr`
- the function name
- the raw Lumina metadata payload
- tombstone state for deletes

That layout lets `dazhbog` answer three different kinds of query from the same corpus:

- **latest-value lookup** through the persistent key index
- **history traversal** by following `prev_addr`
- **binary/context-driven retrieval** by joining against `context_db`

### Serving layers

1. **Lumina RPC server** - handles Lumina clients, protocol negotiation, pull/push/delete/history flows, TLS, and upstream forwarding
2. **HTTP server** - serves the dashboard, JSON APIs, metrics, and cleartext HTTP/2 (`h2c`)

When TLS is enabled, the server can also expose HTTP over the Lumina side with ALPN-aware handling.

### Version selection

When multiple versions exist for a key, `dazhbog` scores candidates using weighted signals:

- exact binary MD5 match
- basename suffix similarity
- binary co-occurrence probability
- observation stability
- recency
- binary popularity

If context data is not available yet, it falls back to the latest stored version.

### Protocol and transport

- Lumina protocol versions `0` through `6`
- plaintext or TLS on the Lumina side
- HTTP/1.1 and cleartext HTTP/2 (`h2c`) on the HTTP side
- optional HTTP handling on the TLS/Lumina side when enabled
- optional upstream miss forwarding with priority ordering

## Repository map

- `src/main.rs` - server entrypoint
- `src/db/` - high-level database API, search enrichment, binary compare logic, version scoring
- `src/engine/` - segments, indexes, context index, search index, runtime wiring

## Quick start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/dazhbog config.toml

# If IDA should use plaintext instead of TLS
export LUMINA_TLS=false
```

In IDA, point Lumina at your configured host and port and use `guest` / `guest`.

For a live instance, use the public server block at the top of this README.

## Configuration

The config file looks like TOML, but the parser is intentionally lightweight rather than a full TOML implementation. Dotted keys and `#` comments work; advanced TOML features do not.

Main config groups:

- `limits.*` - protocol and memory limits
- `engine.*` - storage paths, segment size, mmap reads, deduplication, index tuning
- `lumina.*` - bind address, deletes, history, TLS enablement
- `tls.*` - PKCS#12 or PEM certificate settings
- `http.*` - HTTP bind address
- `upstream.<n>.*` - ordered upstream Lumina servers
- `scoring.*` - version-selection weights and caps
- `debug.*` - protocol hello dumping

TLS modes:

- **PKCS#12 / native-tls** - fits IDA-style certificate setups
- **PEM / rustls** - preferred for modern browser behavior and HTTP/2 ALPN

If both are configured, the code prefers the PEM/rustls path.

### Important operational settings

- `engine.deduplicate_on_startup` - rewrites away redundant records at startup; effective, but slow on large corpora
- `lumina.get_history_limit` - caps history traversal returned to clients
- `limits.max_pull_items` / `limits.max_push_items` - controls large batch behavior from clients
- `scoring.*` - controls how aggressively context influences version selection
- `upstream.<n>.priority` - lower number means higher precedence for miss forwarding

### Example config

```toml
# Connection and resource limits
limits.hello_timeout_ms = 3000
limits.command_timeout_ms = 15000
limits.max_active_conns = 2048
limits.max_pull_items = 524288
limits.max_push_items = 524288

# Storage engine
engine.data_dir = "data"
engine.segment_bytes = 1073741824
engine.shard_count = 64
engine.index_capacity = 1073741824
engine.deduplicate_on_startup = false

# Lumina server
lumina.bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:1234"
lumina.server_name = "dazhbog"
lumina.allow_deletes = false
lumina.get_history_limit = 32
lumina.use_tls = false

# HTTP server
http.bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"

# Optional upstream
upstream.0.enabled = true
upstream.0.priority = 0
upstream.0.host = "lumina.hex-rays.com"
upstream.0.port = 443
upstream.0.use_tls = true
upstream.0.insecure_no_verify = true
upstream.0.hello_protocol_version = 6
upstream.0.license_path = "license.hexlic"
upstream.0.timeout_ms = 8000
upstream.0.batch_max = 131072
```

## Admin and recovery commands

```bash
# List sled trees
./target/release/recover --list-trees data

# Migrate old context trees into context_db
./target/release/recover --migrate-context data

# Rebuild the latest key index
./target/release/recover --rebuild-index data

# Rebuild per-key basenames from binary metadata
./target/release/recover --rebuild-basenames data

# Rebuild the search index
./target/release/recover --rebuild-search data

# Run the combined rebuild flow
./target/release/recover --rebuild-all data
```

Other helpers:

```bash
# Dump metadata payloads for parser work
./target/release/dump_functions --dump 2000 analysis/data

# Dump function names from the corpus
./target/release/dump_function_names --output function_names.txt --unique
```

The recovery tool covers context migration, search refreshes, basename reconstruction, and full rebuild flows.

## API surface

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/` | Interactive dashboard |
| `/api/search?q=...&mode=functions|binaries` | Function or binary search |
| `/api/function/:key` | Full function detail, parsed metadata, binaries |
| `/api/binary/:md5` | Binary summary plus facets, related views, and overview data |
| `/api/binary/:md5/functions` | Paginated function list for a binary |
| `/api/binary/:md5/overlap` | Related binaries by shared functions |
| `/api/binary/:md5/graph` | Graph neighborhood data |
| `/api/binary-compare/:left/:right` | Binary-to-binary comparison |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus scrape endpoint |
| `/api/metrics` | Metrics JSON snapshot |

## Binary intelligence

`dazhbog` models how functions appear across binaries, not just how they map to keys.

Each function can be linked to:

- binaries that contained it
- last-seen versions for specific binaries
- observation counts
- basename aliases
- host information
- overlap caches
- facet summaries like typed/commented/switch-heavy coverage

That enables:

- binary search by basename
- paging through functions for a binary
- binary-family timelines
- related-binary discovery by overlap
- graph exploration around a binary neighborhood
- direct binary-to-binary comparison across shared and unique sets

## Metadata analysis workflow

Use the parser workflow in `analysis/` for validation and exploration:

```bash
./target/release/dump_functions --dump 2000 analysis/data
python3 analysis/lumina_metadata.py
python3 analysis/fast_parser.py
```

## Testing

Run the full suite:

```bash
cargo test --all -- --nocapture
```

Focused runs:

```bash
cargo test metadata_parser -- --nocapture
cargo test protocol_test -- --nocapture
```

Current coverage includes:

- metadata parser tests against real dumped payloads
- live protocol handshake and pull behavior tests
- boundary and fuzz-style network tests
- TLS/security placeholders and stress-oriented suites

Some integration tests expect a live local server and will skip if it is not running.

## Notes

- **Auth model** - username must be `guest`; password validation is intentionally minimal
- **Network posture** - best used on trusted networks unless you place it behind your own access controls
- **Migration** - run `recover --migrate-context` if `context_db` is missing
- **Search quality** - best after rebuilding basenames and search data from a populated context database
- **Runtime split** - RPC and HTTP work run on dedicated runtimes to keep the UI responsive under protocol load
- **Demangling** - search and detail views can expose precomputed demangled names and language hints
- **Parser provenance** - the Rust metadata parser was validated against dumped real-world payloads in `analysis/`
- **Name** - Dazhbog is a Slavic sun deity
